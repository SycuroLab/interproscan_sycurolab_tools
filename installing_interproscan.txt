md5sum -c interproscan-5.65-97.0-64-bit.tar.gz.md5
# Must return *interproscan-5.65-97.0-64-bit.tar.gz: OK*
# If not - try downloading the file again as it may be a corrupted copy.

##### INSTALL CONDA
## Creating the interproscan conda environment.

conda create --name interproscan_env
conda activate interproscan_env
conda install -c conda-forge python
conda install -c conda-forge perl
conda install -c conda-forge openjdk


# Try running interproscan_sbatch.sh first let me know if it works. Need to update readme with those instructions for others.
sbatch interproscan_sbatch.sh 

### Run this command if the above doesn't work and let me know. 
python3 setup.py -f interproscan.properties

## InterProScan test run

Using the Local Pre-calculated Match Lookup Service (optional)

# To turn off the use of the service, either use the -dp command line option or edit interproscan.properties and add a # to the start of the following line to comment out the line or delete the following line, near the bottom of the file:

precalculated.match.lookup.service.url=http://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/match-lookup


You can then run the following test case command:

./interproscan.sh -i test_all_appl.fasta -f tsv -dp
